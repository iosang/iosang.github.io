\begin{itemize}

\item Developer of the platform Nomothesi@, which functions as a portal of greek legislative text from all documents of the National Printing House. We extract legal, geospatial and textual references to entities, digitalizing this data as Semantic Web data by utilizing structured/semi-structured data with ontologies. Still contributing to the project when time allows. \url{http://legislation.di.uoa.gr/}

\item \begin{sloppypar}
\textbf{MSc Thesis} ``Named Entity Recognition and Linking in Greek Legislation''. Supervisors: Manolis Koubarakis (Professor, NKUA), Ilias Chalkidis (PhD Candidate, AUEB).
The main focus was on neural networks technologies in the area of natural language processing with the aim of extracting named entities (persons, organisations, legal references, geo-political entities, public documents and unofficial geographical landmarks), 
converting them into Semantic Web data and then linking them with other third party Semantic Web data (Greek Administrative Geography, Greek DBpedia ) using Silk. \url{https://tinyurl.com/ybkqfdpz}

\end{sloppypar}

\item \begin{sloppypar}
\textbf{Undergrad Thesis} ``Capacitated Vehicle Routing with Time Windows''. Supervisors: Alex Delis (Professor, NKUA), Panagiotis Liakos (PhD, NKUA). 
The main focus was addressing the titular problem, implement an adapted $A^{*}$ algo to visualize the shortest paths between stops of the vehicles. To that end, geospatial information was being handled with a Postgres/PostGIS database. \url{https://tinyurl.com/y7gozlkm}

\end{sloppypar}

\item \begin{sloppypar}
``Cooperative Routing and Scheduling of an Electric Vehicle Fleet Managing Dynamic Customer Requests''. A work in collaboration with Alex Delis (Professor, NKUA) and Panagiotis Liakos (PhD, NKUA). 
Development of an online algo that uses 3 distinct strategies to optimize routing and scheduling information of an electric vehicle fleet requiring recharging and compare all three. The problem addressed here is a new addition to the VRP-family of NP-hard problems. \url{https://tinyurl.com/yabjsq7r}

\end{sloppypar}

\item Working on an Android app with RESTful services offering a similar functionality to Airbnb for ``e-Commerce'' class with geospatial functionalities, Google Maps and locating addresses. \url{https://tinyurl.com/y9no2wv7}

\item Participation in a 3-member team where the representation of multiple social networks as graphs, graph quries (multi-threaded) and multiple metrics regarding communities and cliques finding were implemented (in C) for ``Software Development'' undergrad course.

\item Development of a lending library website with user roles and shopping cart functionalities for ``Human-Computer Interaction'' undergrad course. \url{https://tinyurl.com/y8oq4kb3}
