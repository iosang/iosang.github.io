\subsection*{Short summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Short summary}

\begin{sloppypar}
	Iosif Angelidis is a new IT professional with three (3) years of experience in software development stemming. 
	His IT skills spam from IT programming with actual experience in C, C++, Java and Python among other languages. 
	This knowledge is gained both from self-motive to invest in new skill-sets and as part of his two years engagement in a Named Entity Recognizer thesis, 
	which recognizes and extracts persons, organizations, geo-political entities, legal references, public documents and 
	unofficial geographical landmarks found in the Government Gazette by utilizing Neural Networks and Deep Learning technologies.
	
	During his military tour, Iosif has been occupied in the IT Division offering his experience in supporting 3 projects: MIP 3, ΣΧΚ and ΣΔΕΠ. This support came in the form of major refactoring, implementation of new features, optimization and critical performance gains, as well as general user support. His responsibilities further included the training of new staff and knowledge transferring.
	
	Iosif Angelidis has also shown particular interest in Artificial Intelligence courses both as a tutor (assistant professor) and as a practitioner. 
	Last, but not least, Iosif has become a member of various communities among which the most notable ones pertain to the Management of Data and Information Knowledge Group (\href{http://www.madgik.di.uoa.gr}{MADgIK}) and the \href{http://ai.di.uoa.gr/}{AI group} of the University of Athens.
